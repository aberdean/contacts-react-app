# Contacts React App
---

A simple React app built as an exercise for the Front-End Nanodegree.

The app is an address book where you can see the list of your contacts, add new
contacts and remove the ones you don't need anymore.

To get started, clone the server project issuing the following commands at your
terminal or command line.
